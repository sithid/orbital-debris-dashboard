## Getting started

1. **Fork this repo** (use the badge above) and clone your fork. Rename the directory to match your project.
2. **Install Claude Code** if you haven't. See [the docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).
3. **Install Wrangler:** `npm install -g wrangler`, then `wrangler login`.
4. **Open Claude Code in the project directory:** `claude`.
5. **Run the PM interview** to produce your PRD. It writes directly into `docs/PRD.md`:
   ```
   > Use the pm-interview skill to help me write a PRD for [your idea]
   ```
6. **Run the design-brief interview** once the PRD is stable. Output goes to `docs/DESIGN.md`:
   ```
   > Use the design-brief skill to help me fill out docs/DESIGN.md
   ```
   Defaults are React + Headless UI + Tailwind. The brief captures any deviation.
7. **Bootstrap your app** with `npm create cloudflare@latest` once the PRD and design brief are clear enough.
8. **Run the build-plan interview** after bootstrapping, before writing real features. Output goes to `docs/BUILDPLAN.md`:
   ```
   > Use the build-plan skill to help me fill out docs/BUILDPLAN.md
   ```
   Output is 3–6 phases sized to fit one Claude Code session each. Re-run it when the plan drifts from reality.

## The skills

Use them like this:

| When you're... | Use the skill... |
|---|---|
| Starting a new project or feature | `pm-interview` |
| About to build UI for the first time | `design-brief` |
| About to start coding a project | `build-plan` |
| About to commit a chunk of AI-written code | `rubber-duck-quiz` |
| Staring at code you don't fully grasp | `explain-this-code` |
| Planning architecture or reviewing your own | `architecture-diagram` |
| Unsure which Cloudflare product to use | `cloudflare-product-picker` |

You don't have to name the skill — Claude will pick it up from context. But saying "use the rubber-duck-quiz skill" forces it.

## Hooks

`.claude/settings.json` ships with a **Stop hook** that runs `npm test` whenever Claude finishes a turn — Claude sees failures and keeps working. This enforces TDD without per-edit noise.

If you want stricter behavior, swap the Stop hook for a `PostToolUse` hook (runs after every edit). Edit `.claude/settings.json` and ask Claude — the `update-config` skill knows the format.

## Course rules

- **No `--dangerously-skip-permissions` until week 3.** Read every diff.
- **Run `rubber-duck-quiz` before every meaningful commit.** Claude can draft the commit message and run `git commit` for you — that's encouraged. The rule is that you must understand the change well enough to defend it before it lands.
- **Architecture diagrams get regenerated every week.** If it no longer matches the code, something drifted.
- **Two videos required, both linked in this README:**
  - A **PRD explainer video** (≤5 min) recorded after week 1.
  - A **demo video** (≤5 min) recorded by week 4 — the deployed app plus 2–3 file-level decisions.
