# Project Context for Claude

This file tells Claude how to work on this codebase. Keep it accurate — an out-of-date CLAUDE.md is worse than no CLAUDE.md at all.

## About this project

**What it is:** A public, read-only dashboard that lets researchers and space enthusiasts visually explore a merged SATCAT + UCS orbital debris dataset (68,727 objects) — search, filter, and drill into any satellite or debris object in under 30 seconds.

**Who it's for:** Researchers who currently use Space-Track.org or Celestrak raw tables and want a combined, visual interface to explore orbital crowding and individual object details without writing queries.

**Product requirements:** The full PRD lives in `docs/PRD.md`. Read it before making meaningful architectural or feature decisions.

**Design brief:** UI/UX decisions live in `docs/DESIGN.md`. Read it before writing UI code or making visual choices. The defaults captured there are React + Headless UI + Tailwind CSS unless the brief says otherwise.

**Build plan:** The phased build plan lives in `docs/BUILDPLAN.md`. Read it to know which phase is current, what files that phase touches, and what context to load. Each phase names exactly which PRD/DESIGN sections and files to load — honor that scope to keep sessions cheap. If you're starting work that isn't covered by the current phase, stop and ask whether the plan needs to change.

## Tech stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, served as static assets by the Cloudflare Worker (SPA fallback).
- **Backend:** A single Cloudflare Worker (`worker/index.ts`) with a `fetch` handler that routes `/api/*` requests. Built with the `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` (Workers + Static Assets), not the older Pages Functions file-routing model.
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite — seeded from `orbital_debris.db`), bound as `env.DB`.
- **Testing:** Vitest with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`
- **Deployment:** Wrangler to Cloudflare Workers (`npm run deploy`)

## How to work on this code

### Before writing code

1. Read the relevant section of `docs/PRD.md`.
2. If the change is UI-related, also read the relevant section of `docs/DESIGN.md`. Honor the component, token, and a11y choices captured there.
3. If the change is non-trivial (more than a few lines), use plan mode (`shift+tab` to enter it) and share the plan before making edits.
4. Check if there's an existing pattern in the codebase you should follow. Don't invent new patterns when an old one works.

### While writing code

- **TDD is the default.** Write a failing test first, then make it pass, then refactor. If you skip tests, say so explicitly and why.
- Run `npm test` after every logical unit of work. Do not consider a task complete until tests pass.
- Prefer small, composable functions over large ones.
- Use TypeScript strictly — no `any` unless there's a real reason, and then comment why.

### After writing code

- Run `npm test` and confirm it passes.
- Run `npm run typecheck` if the project has one.
- Summarize what changed in 1–3 sentences. This summary becomes the commit message.

### What NOT to do

- Don't add dependencies without asking. If a library would help, propose it and wait.
- Don't delete tests to make them pass. Fix the code or update the test intentionally.
- Don't commit secrets. Use `wrangler secret` for production values and `.dev.vars` (gitignored) for local.
- Don't use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` style flags silently. If autonomy increases, tell the human.

## Cloudflare-specific notes

- Use `npm run dev` (Vite + the Cloudflare plugin) for local development. It runs the real Workers runtime (workerd), not Node.
- Environment bindings (D1, R2, KV, Workers AI) are declared in `wrangler.jsonc` and accessed via `env.BINDING_NAME`, not `process.env`.
- For Cloudflare docs, two LLM-optimized entry points exist:
  - `https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt` — the **index**. Lightweight; fetch this first to see what products and pages exist and to find the right deeper link.
  - `https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms-full.txt` — the full corpus. Heavy; only fetch this (or a specific page from the index) when you need real product details.
  - Rule of thumb: when a Cloudflare question comes up, fetch `llms.txt` first, locate the right section, then fetch only that section. Don't guess from training data when current docs are one fetch away.
- Workers have limits (CPU time, size, subrequests). If a design pushes against these, flag it.

## Teach-back mode

This is a learning project. When the human asks "explain this" or "quiz me on this," switch into teaching mode:

- Don't just describe what the code does — explain *why* it's written this way and what the alternatives were.
- When quizzing, ask one question at a time. Wait for an answer. If the answer is wrong or partial, help them get to the right answer through questions, not by telling them.
- If the human can't explain a piece of code, that's a signal we moved too fast. Slow down, refactor for clarity, or add comments.

## Project-specific rules

- All API routes live under `/api/`. Don't add routes outside that prefix.
- **Never load all rows client-side.** 68,727 objects require server-side pagination and filtering via D1 queries. Any approach that fetches the full table to the browser is wrong.
- The source database is at `E:/repos/orbital-debris-assessment/data/clean/orbital_debris.db`. Do not modify it — it is the upstream pipeline output. Seed D1 from it; don't treat D1 as the source of truth for schema decisions.
- v1 is read-only. No writes, no auth, no user accounts. If a feature requires any of those, it belongs in v2.
- The 3D globe visualization is explicitly deferred to v2. Do not add CesiumJS, Three.js, or any globe library in v1.
